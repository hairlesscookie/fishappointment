Sammy woke me up with the loudest chirp his tiny self could muster. There was a kitten clawing the window close to his cage. I could recognize the scraping even in my dreams. I raised my hand as if taking an oath, just enough for it to be visible out the glass. There was a thud, followed by the sound of rustling leaves. Sammy's chirps turned to infrequent squeaks. I slowly crawled out of the bed and looked at his cage. He was hopping about the food bowl, still some left, but he could not reach it for the life of him. He gave up trying after his first attempt landed him in a ramdev style awkward stretch with legs on each side of the bowl. Which was stupid, as I did sprinkle some on a sheet next to him as well. I took the bowl out while he looked at me wide-eyed, probably with the intention to rip my hand off for not leaving him with a mountain of midnight snacks. His squeaks quieted down for a bit while I got myself prepped for work. My living room was more damp than usual; about time I let some sunlight into the dark, dungeon-y part of my place. Ehh, it's cold and foggy anyways, not like any light would affect it. I made my way to the TV that I unsurprisingly forgot to turn off last night. I pressed the power button and dialed the knob over to the news... static. Surprising, but honestly, it would keep me from having a crappy mood on the way to work. Sammy sort of enjoyed the sound of people talking, though. Or maybe specifically the screaming and shouting over each other. I let the static stay on while I got ready. I was no different from Sammy, I guess. It was a typical "nothing-ever-happens" sort of day. People fretting over deadlines, over incompetence, over doing this instead of spending time with their family. Closing time, and I turned off the screen burning my eyes for the last few hours, or the last decade; it depends on how you look at it. The way home consisted of me sneering at the cars stuck in traffic with enough shining lights to be a gamer's sweetest dream while I'm on a metro up high... with more people in my one-meter radius than there were in my family. Almost everyone had their eyes glued to their phones; even I had my earphones plugged in my ears. A guy next to me had a news channel streaming on his phone. The outlet probably fixed itself, or my old TV was finally showing its age... nah can't be that. I took an earplug out, but shockingly enough, I heard just static from that phone. The guy was still looking at those moving faces as if he was hearing coherent sentences. I put the earbud back on for the sake of my sanity and almost forgot about the incident by the time I reached my place. I turned on the corridor lights and walked into the living room. Sammy was quieter than usual. I put the TV on, still static, but Sammy gave a couple of acknowledging chirps, so I let it stay on. I walked into the bedroom and opened Sammy's cage to refill his food bowl. one of his eyes affixed at the window and the other at me. It'd be weird of him to hold a grudge this long. "Still angry, huh, old guy?" I asked as I got up. Washed myself up and hit the bed. Sammy had his eyes on me for quite a bit before he closed his, and I closed mine.<br>I woke up to Sammy's chirps again. Raised my arm, a thud, rustling of dried-up leaves. He quiets down. Bits of struggles with my blanket, and I somehow managed to reach Sammy's cage for his morning refill. He hopped onto the bowl as I fixed it in. I couldn't recall him ever doing that, especially while my hand was still there. He just stood at the bowl's edge, as if deep in thought, then went on to rest his head against my fingers and close his eyes. I ran my finger across his head, and he let a couple of squeaks before getting back to his bowl. I got up and headed to the living room. Turned the TV on and dialed the knob... still static, quiet chirp from Sammy. I got dressed up for work, turned the TV off, and headed out. The day went by quite slowly. The sun hadn't been out for a few days now. Closing time. I put my coffee mug in the dishwasher and headed home. I was passing through the weekly market when a pack of corn kernels caught my eye. Sammy loved those more than anything else in this world. I got one thinking this ought to make him forget his anger. Reached home and turned on the corridor lights, anticipating Sammy's reaction to the kernels. The house had a sickening silence over it. I stepped into the bedroom to see him lying motionless at the bottom of his cage. I held him next to my ear... the same silence. A couple of frantic calls to our vet, a eulogy, and a backyard burial later. I was sitting at the edge of my bed, looking at his empty cage. Laid down and took an hour, maybe more, before I was asleep.<br>I woke up to a familiar clawing on the window pane. Raised my hand... the clawing continued. I pulled myself out of bed. The kitten clawed again, slower this time. I slowly moved my hand towards the window sill. The kitten moved a bit back but still didn't seem scared. I lifted the sill up a bit. It gave me an acknowledging look, hopped down to the floor, jumped onto the bed and curled itself up over my blanket. It let out a purr. I walked into the living room. A gap between the blinds let in a streak of sunlight. I closed it up and the room was back to being itself. I turned the TV on and dialed the knob over to the news. The weather guy popped up and went on with his crap about the days getting brighter, sunnier. I got ready for work. Put up a couple of salami slices at the kitchen counter and left a gap at the window sill. Sammy's cage still stood empty next to my bed and I couldn't be bothered to move it so soon. The kitten had found its place on my sheets. I opened the door and stepped out.
